# BerthCare MVP: Comprehensive Product Management Analysis

## Executive Summary

### Elevator Pitch
BerthCare is a mobile app that lets home care nurses document patient visits in real-time on their phones, cutting paperwork time in half and giving families instant updates on their loved one's care.

### Problem Statement
Home care staff waste 50% of their shift time on duplicate data entry and after-hours paperwork, leading to inefficient care delivery, staff burnout, and poor family communication. Current systems require documentation to be completed back at the office, creating a disconnect between point-of-care and record-keeping.

### Target Audience
**Primary:** Home care nurses and personal support workers in Alberta's health system
- Demographics: 25-55 years old, varying tech comfort levels
- Pain points: Administrative burden, paper-based workflows, after-hours documentation
- Size: ~30 staff members in pilot zones, expanding to thousands province-wide

**Secondary:** Families of home care recipients
- Demographics: Adult children (35-65) of elderly patients
- Pain points: Lack of visibility into care delivery, communication gaps
- Needs: Basic transparency and peace of mind

### Unique Selling Proposition
Unlike existing solutions, BerthCare combines offline-first mobile documentation with intelligent data reuse, reducing documentation time from 15-20 minutes to under 10 minutes per visit while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in documentation time (target: <10 minutes per visit)
- 80% staff adoption rate within 90 days
- 70% family satisfaction improvement
- ROI positive within 90 days through time savings

## Feature Specifications

### Feature 1: Mobile Point-of-Care Documentation
**User Story:** As a home care nurse, I want to document patient assessments directly on my mobile device during visits, so that I can eliminate after-hours paperwork and reduce documentation time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm at a patient's location, when I open the app, then I can access that patient's profile and documentation forms
- Given I'm documenting offline, when connectivity returns, then all data syncs automatically without data loss
- Given I complete a visit, when I save the documentation, then the visit is marked complete with timestamp and GPS verification
- Edge case: App must function for 8+ hours offline with multiple patient visits
- Edge case: Battery optimization to prevent app crashes during long shifts

**Priority:** P0 - Core value proposition
**Dependencies:** Mobile app framework, offline database, GPS functionality
**Technical Constraints:** Must work on iOS and Android, offline-first architecture required
**UX Considerations:** Large touch targets for use with gloves, voice-to-text for efficiency

### Feature 2: Smart Data Reuse
**User Story:** As a home care worker, I want to copy previous visit data and edit only what changed, so that I don't have to re-enter repetitive information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I start a new visit, when I select "Copy from last visit," then all unchanged fields are pre-populated
- Given I'm documenting vital signs, when previous readings exist, then they appear with clear edit indicators
- Given I use quick notes, when I select common phrases, then they auto-complete with customization options
- Edge case: Handle missing previous data gracefully
- Edge case: Prevent accidental copying of time-sensitive information

**Priority:** P0 - Directly addresses primary pain point
**Dependencies:** Historical data access, template engine
**Technical Constraints:** Data versioning for audit trails
**UX Considerations:** Clear visual indicators for copied vs. new data

### Feature 3: Basic Care Coordination
**User Story:** As a care team member, I want to communicate urgent issues and see shared care plans, so that we can coordinate patient care effectively.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I identify an urgent issue, when I flag it in the app, then relevant team members receive push notifications
- Given a care plan update, when it's saved, then all team members see the change in real-time
- Given I need to contact a team member, when I access the directory, then I can message or call directly from the app
- Edge case: Handle notification failures with retry logic
- Edge case: Offline messaging with sync when connected

**Priority:** P1 - Important but not critical for initial value
**Dependencies:** Push notification service, messaging infrastructure
**Technical Constraints:** HIA-compliant messaging, role-based access
**UX Considerations:** Clear notification hierarchy, easy team member identification

### Feature 4: Simple Family Portal
**User Story:** As a family member, I want to see when care visits happen and view basic care information, so that I feel informed about my loved one's care.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have portal access, when I log in, then I see visit schedules and completion status
- Given a care plan exists, when I view it, then it's presented in plain language
- Given I need to contact the care team, when I use the contact button, then I'm connected to the appropriate coordinator
- Edge case: Handle multiple family members with different access levels
- Edge case: Ensure read-only access with no edit capabilities

**Priority:** P1 - Important for family satisfaction but not core workflow
**Dependencies:** Web portal development, access control system
**Technical Constraints:** Separate authentication from staff app
**UX Considerations:** Non-technical language, mobile-responsive design

### Feature 5: Electronic Visit Verification
**User Story:** As a supervisor, I want automated verification of visit times and locations, so that I can ensure compliance and accurate billing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a staff member arrives at a patient location, when they check in, then GPS coordinates and time are automatically recorded
- Given a visit is complete, when the staff member checks out, then duration is calculated and stored
- Given a visit checklist exists, when tasks are completed, then progress is tracked and reported
- Edge case: Handle GPS inaccuracy in rural areas or apartments
- Edge case: Backup check-in methods when GPS fails

**Priority:** P1 - Required for reimbursement compliance
**Dependencies:** GPS services, geofencing capabilities
**Technical Constraints:** Location privacy compliance, battery optimization
**UX Considerations:** Automatic when possible, minimal manual intervention

### Feature 6: Export/Import Bridge
**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to export visit data and import client information, so that BerthCare can coexist with existing systems during transition.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given completed visits exist, when I export data, then I receive formatted PDF reports
- Given a client roster update, when I import CSV data, then client profiles are updated without duplication
- Given daily activities occur, when the day ends, then supervisors receive automated summary emails
- Edge case: Handle malformed import data with clear error messages
- Edge case: Large export files that exceed email limits

**Priority:** P2 - Enabler for adoption but not core user value
**Dependencies:** File processing services, email integration
**Technical Constraints:** Data format standardization, error handling
**UX Considerations:** Simple import wizards, clear success/failure feedback
