**Feature Branch:** `feat/client-management`  
**Issue:** #3  
**Dependencies:** Authentication system (PR #2)  
**Estimated Effort:** 8.5 days

## Implementation Checklist

### Database Schema (Tasks C1, C2)

- [ ] **C1: Clients Table Migration**
  - [ ] Create migration file `002_create_clients.sql`
  - [ ] Define `clients` table with all required fields:
    - id, first_name, last_name, date_of_birth
    - address, latitude, longitude, phone
    - emergency_contact_name, emergency_contact_phone, emergency_contact_relationship
    - zone_id, created_at, updated_at
  - [ ] Add index on `zone_id`
  - [ ] Add index on `last_name`
  - [ ] Create rollback migration `002_create_clients_rollback.sql`
  - [ ] Run migration successfully on local database
  - [ ] Verify schema matches specifications

- [ ] **C2: Care Plans Table Migration**
  - [ ] Create migration file `003_create_care_plans.sql`
  - [ ] Define `care_plans` table with all required fields:
    - id, client_id, summary
    - medications (JSONB), allergies (JSONB)
    - special_instructions (TEXT), version
    - created_at, updated_at
  - [ ] Add foreign key constraint to `clients` table
  - [ ] Add index on `client_id`
  - [ ] Create rollback migration `003_create_care_plans_rollback.sql`
  - [ ] Run migration successfully on local database
  - [ ] Verify foreign key relationships work

### API Endpoints

- [ ] **C3: GET /v1/clients (List Clients)**
  - [ ] Implement endpoint with pagination (default 50, max 100)
  - [ ] Add filtering by `zone_id`
  - [ ] Add search by name (first_name or last_name)
  - [ ] Return client summary with last visit date
  - [ ] Implement Redis caching (5 min TTL)
  - [ ] Require JWT authentication
  - [ ] Add integration tests:
    - Returns paginated clients
    - Filtering by zone works
    - Search by name works
    - Caching works (verify Redis hit)
    - Unauthorized access returns 401

- [ ] **C4: GET /v1/clients/:clientId (Get Client Details)**
  - [ ] Implement endpoint to fetch full client details
  - [ ] Include care plan in response
  - [ ] Include emergency contact information
  - [ ] Include recent visits (last 10)
  - [ ] Implement Redis caching (15 min TTL)
  - [ ] Require JWT authentication
  - [ ] Implement zone authorization (user can only access clients in their zone)
  - [ ] Add integration tests:
    - Returns full client data
    - 404 for non-existent client
    - 403 for client in different zone
    - Caching works
    - Cache invalidation on update

- [ ] **C5: POST /v1/clients (Create Client)**
  - [ ] Implement endpoint to create new client
  - [ ] Validate required fields (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, address)
  - [ ] Integrate Google Maps Geocoding API to convert address to lat/long
  - [ ] Assign client to zone based on geocoded location
  - [ ] Create default care plan for new client
  - [ ] Require admin role authorization
  - [ ] Add integration tests:
    - Creates client successfully with valid data
    - Geocoding works and populates lat/long
    - Zone assignment works
    - Default care plan created
    - Validation errors return 400
    - Non-admin users get 403

- [ ] **C6: PATCH /v1/clients/:clientId (Update Client)**
  - [ ] Implement endpoint to update client details
  - [ ] Support partial updates (only update provided fields)
  - [ ] Invalidate Redis cache on successful update
  - [ ] Log changes to audit trail
  - [ ] Require coordinator or admin role
  - [ ] Add integration tests:
    - Updates client successfully
    - Partial updates work
    - Cache invalidated after update
    - Audit trail logged
    - 404 for non-existent client
    - 403 for insufficient permissions

- [ ] **C7: POST /v1/care-plans (Create/Update Care Plan)**
  - [ ] Implement endpoint to create or update care plan
  - [ ] Support versioning (increment version on each update)
  - [ ] Validate medications format (JSONB array)
  - [ ] Validate allergies format (JSONB array)
  - [ ] Require coordinator or admin role
  - [ ] Add integration tests:
    - Creates new care plan successfully
    - Updates existing care plan and increments version
    - Validation works for medications/allergies
    - 403 for insufficient permissions
    - Version history maintained

### Security & Authorization

- [ ] All endpoints require JWT authentication
- [ ] Zone-based authorization implemented for GET /v1/clients/:clientId
- [ ] Role-based authorization (admin, coordinator) implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection protection (parameterized queries)
- [ ] Rate limiting configured

### Caching Strategy

- [ ] Redis caching implemented for GET /v1/clients (5 min TTL)
- [ ] Redis caching implemented for GET /v1/clients/:clientId (15 min TTL)
- [ ] Cache invalidation on POST /v1/clients
- [ ] Cache invalidation on PATCH /v1/clients/:clientId
- [ ] Cache invalidation on POST /v1/care-plans

### External Integrations

- [ ] Google Maps Geocoding API integration
- [ ] API key stored in environment variables
- [ ] Error handling for geocoding failures
- [ ] Fallback behavior if geocoding unavailable

### Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for all service functions
- [ ] Integration tests for all endpoints
- [ ] Test coverage â‰¥80%
- [ ] Edge cases covered:
  - Invalid input data
  - Missing required fields
  - Duplicate client detection
  - Geocoding API failures
  - Cache failures
  - Database connection errors
  - Unauthorized access attempts

### Documentation

- [ ] API endpoint documentation in `/docs/client-management-api.md`
- [ ] Database schema documented in migration files
- [ ] Code comments for complex business logic
- [ ] Update MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md with new migrations
- [ ] Update README.md with new endpoints

### Code Quality

### Manual Testing

```bash
# 1. Create a client (admin only)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "first_name": "John",

    "emergency_contact_phone": "+14165555678",
    "emergency_contact_relationship": "Daughter"
  }'

# 2. List clients
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/clients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

    "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
    "summary": "Daily medication management and mobility assistance",
    "medications": [
      {"name": "Metformin", "dosage": "500mg", "frequency": "twice daily"}
    ],
    "allergies": [
      {"allergen": "Penicillin", "severity": "severe"}
    ],
    "special_instructions": "Client prefers morning visits before 10am"
  }'
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run client management tests only
npm test -- apps/backend/tests/clients

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Performance Considerations

- [ ] Database queries optimized with proper indexes
- [ ] Redis caching reduces database load
- [ ] Pagination prevents large result sets
- [ ] Geocoding results cached to avoid repeated API calls
- [ ] Connection pooling configured for PostgreSQL

---

## Security Considerations

- [ ] All endpoints require authentication
- [ ] Zone-based authorization prevents cross-zone access
- [ ] Role-based authorization for admin/coordinator actions
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks
- [ ] Sensitive data (emergency contacts) only accessible to authorized users
- [ ] Audit trail logs all client data modifications

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after merge:

1. Revert the PR: `git revert MERGE_COMMIT_SHA`
2. Roll back database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:down -- 003_create_care_plans
   npm run migrate:down -- 002_create_clients
   ```
3. Clear Redis cache: `redis-cli FLUSHDB`
