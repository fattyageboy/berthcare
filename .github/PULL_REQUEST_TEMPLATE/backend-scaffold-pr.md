## Backend Scaffold - Phase B (Tasks G1, B1-B4, G2)

### Overview

This PR implements the complete backend core infrastructure for BerthCare, including Express.js setup, database connections, Redis caching, and S3 storage configuration.

### Tasks Completed

#### G1: Create feature branch – backend scaffold ✅

- [x] Branch `feat/backend-scaffold` from `main`
- [x] Link to issue #1
- [x] Open draft PR with checklist

#### B1: Initialize Express.js backend ✅

- [x] Set up Express.js 4.x with TypeScript
- [x] Configure middleware (helmet, cors, compression, express-rate-limit)
- [x] Create health check endpoint `GET /health`
- [x] Configure logging (Winston)
- [x] Set up error handling middleware
- [x] Port 3000 for local development

#### B2: Configure database connection ✅

- [x] Set up PostgreSQL connection using `pg` library
- [x] Configure connection pooling (max 20 connections)
- [x] Create database migration framework setup
- [x] Implement connection health check
- [x] Configure read replica support (placeholder)

#### B3: Configure Redis connection ✅

- [x] Set up Redis client using `ioredis`
- [x] Implement connection retry logic (exponential backoff)
- [x] Create Redis health check
- [x] Configure for session management and caching

#### B4: Set up S3 client ✅

- [x] Configure AWS SDK v3 for S3 (via LocalStack for local dev)
- [x] Implement pre-signed URL generation capability
- [x] Create helper functions for photo storage
- [x] Configure lifecycle policies

### Additional Infrastructure (E3-E8)

- [x] E3: Monorepo structure with Nx
- [x] E4: Docker Compose for local development
- [x] E5: AWS infrastructure (Terraform configs)
- [x] E6: Monitoring & observability (Sentry, CloudWatch)
- [x] E7: Twilio configuration
- [x] E8: Architecture documentation

### Testing

```bash
# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Test backend
cd apps/backend
npm install
npm start

# Verify health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `curl localhost:3000/health` returns 200 with service status
- [x] Backend connects to local PostgreSQL
- [x] Backend connects to local Redis
- [x] Logs to console with proper formatting
- [x] All services start successfully with docker-compose

### Next Steps (G2)

- [ ] Fix any ESLint/TypeScript errors
- [ ] Ensure tests pass
- [ ] Request review from senior backend dev
- [ ] Address feedback
- [ ] Squash-merge using "feat: initialize backend core infrastructure"
