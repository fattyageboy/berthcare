### 3. Git Repository Status

✅ **Repository URL:** https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare.git

✅ **Branch Structure:**

- `main` branch: Base infrastructure
- `feat/auth-system` branch: Current working branch with restored scaffold

✅ **Initial Commit:**

- Commit hash: dfbccff
- Message: "chore: restore base monorepo scaffold files"
- Files: 38 files changed, 22,602 insertions

✅ **Remote Configuration:**

- Origin: https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare.git
- Push/fetch configured correctly

## Branch Protection Requirements

The following branch protections should be enabled on the `main` branch via GitHub settings:

### Required Settings

1. **Require pull request reviews before merging**
   - Required approving reviews: 1
   - Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   - Require review from Code Owners

2. **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Status checks (to be added when CI/CD is set up):
     - `ci/lint`
     - `ci/test`
     - `ci/build`

3. **Require signed commits**
   - All commits must be signed with GPG/SSH key

4. **Restrict who can push to matching branches**
   - Include administrators: No
   - Restrict pushes that create matching branches

5. **Do not allow bypassing the above settings**
   - Enforce all configured restrictions for administrators

### How to Enable Branch Protection

1. Go to: https://github.com/fattyageboy/BerthCare/settings/branches
2. Click "Add branch protection rule"
3. Branch name pattern: `main`
4. Configure settings as listed above
5. Click "Create" or "Save changes"

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Repository exists at GitHub
- [x] README.md describes project overview
- [x] LICENSE file present (MIT)
- [x] .gitignore covers Node.js, React Native, IDE files
- [x] .editorconfig ensures consistent formatting
- [x] CODEOWNERS assigns code review responsibilities
- [x] Design documentation structure in place
- [x] Project documentation structure in place
- [x] Agent definitions for development workflow
- [x] Initial commit visible in repository
- [x] Remote origin configured correctly
- [ ] Branch protections active on `main` (requires manual GitHub configuration)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Enable Branch Protection on `main`**
   - Follow the branch protection settings above
   - Configure via GitHub web interface
   - Verify settings are active

2. **Team Access Configuration**
   - Add team members to GitHub repository
   - Configure team permissions:
     - @berthcare/tech-leads: Admin
     - @berthcare/mobile-team: Write
     - @berthcare/backend-team: Write
     - @berthcare/devops-team: Write
     - @berthcare/design-team: Write
     - @berthcare/security-team: Write

3. **Configure GitHub Repository Settings**
   - Enable "Automatically delete head branches" after PR merge
   - Disable "Allow merge commits" (use squash or rebase)
   - Enable "Allow squash merging" with custom commit message
   - Disable "Allow rebase merging" (to maintain linear history)

### Subsequent Tasks
